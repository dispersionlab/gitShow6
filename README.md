## Run:
Open "harbinger.maxpat"

## Outline and Score:
Harbinger is a mouse controlled synth that utilizes the whole screen.

With the synth toggled on, clicking will output audio according to the current synth parameters. Clicking and holding the mouse button will continue to output sound.

The horizontal (x) movement of the mouse is mapped to the resonance parameter of the filter for the synth, while the vertical (y) movement is mapped to the filter cutoff frequency.

Freezing the synth will keep a continuous output at the current position and no longer listen to mouse input - re-toggle this to return.

Additional audio may be toggled with the x and y noise generators that output noise according to the delta (changes in mouse speed) in x and y movement respectively.

Key commands to toggle audio generators, freezing, reverb, and selecting speed range can be found on the UI.


Try to move through rhythmic pulses slowly and make your way towards noise - getting a smooth transition is sonically very interesting.
Play with the resonance and overtones produced through the pitch and mod for crystalline blips.
